Move along, nothing really to see here.

This is just a small toy I've been playing around with; I attempted to implement a OS kernel back at age 15 and failed miserably.

Now I'm older and understand baremetal better; this is attempt #2. Expect to see stupid shit as I break things, generally fumble around, and fight nail and tooth with paging and potentially non-monolithic design when I get a better handle on shit.

Do not expect this to ever become something vagely useful like Toaru or whatever.

Name may or may not be derived from Mahouka. ;)
